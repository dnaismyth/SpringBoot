# SpringBoot

## Synopsis

A social media web application for users to upload their workouts.  A workout will consist of the run (duration, length, location) they have completed alongside an image if they wish to provide one.  This will be posted into a feed and be displayed to other users who they are followed by.  

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to take the ideas in which I am learning in a work environment and apply them to further become more familiar with the spring mvc framework and developing REST controllers.

The client frontend consuming this REST api can be found at:

## Prototypes

I will be creating and updating prototypes to give me a better idea of what I will need to develop in the backend in order to meet the requirements I would like to include.  These can be found at the following location:
