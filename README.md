# SpringBoot

## Synopsis

A social media web application for users to upload their workouts.  A workout will consist of the activities they have completed (run, bike, swim etc.) alongside an image if they wish to provide one.  This will be posted into a feed and be displayed to other users who they are followed by.  

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to take the ideas in which I am learning in a work environment and apply them to further become more familiar with the spring mvc framework.
